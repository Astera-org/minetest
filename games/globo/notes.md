TODO:
- Each block type has a chance of becoming an item or just disappearing when you break it.
- Trees
- Temperature
    Look at temp system in Exile
    you start to die if not kept in a certain temperature range. It is colder at night. Certain parts of the map are colder. Some days are colder than others. If you are too hot you will lose energy faster and get thirsty faster.
    Energy expenditure raises your core temp
    The air has an ambient temp
    Your core temp goes toward this temperature over time

What can we take from existing mods?
mobs from Exile?

Apple Tree: grows slowly: drops apples occasionally. Has a chance of dropping wood when broken.
Pine Tree:
I )Thorns: Hurts you if pushed into. Burns. Produces berries over time.
I )Potatoes: Grow and spread in the right conditions. Needs water nearby
I )Sumac: Poison berries hurts player if eaten
I )Pulse blossom: glows periodically and hurts anything around it.
I )sun berry: plant that glows when it is in dry soil.
I )Coffee: Gain energy when you eat
I )Grib weed: useless weed that spreads and takes over other plants
Fountain: Will spray water over the nearby blocks.
Slug: takes up a block. Will move in a direction pushed. Picks up the first block in its path and becomes this when it comes to a stop.
I )Corn: needs to be a plant for awhile and then becomes food
Launcher: anything that stands on this is launched in the air in the direction it was going
Conveyor belt: Placed on terrain. Any item on it is conveyed along to the end of the belt

-   Corpse: provides food. Turns to bones

Every 10 seconds Pulse Blossom starts to glow for 2 seconds at the end of the glow it damages any players or mobs around it.


Also grib weed should spread to ground spaces with no flora.

We are trying to use gen_notify to do something when grib weed is created. The grib weed shows up in the world but the gen_notify isn't working. What could be wrong?
